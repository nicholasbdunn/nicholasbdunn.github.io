  title = {GeometryPaste: Geometry-Based Copy-Paste Data Augmentation for Instance Segmentation},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Instance segmentation models require large datasets of annotated images to achieve adequate performance. However, annotated datasets are difficult to build or obtain. There are several large-scale datasets for common objects, but few exist for rare objects. Detecting rare objects has many practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles detecting roadwork objects. Copy-Paste is a data augmentation method for generating images and has been utilized successfully to improve instance segmentation performance. Prior works have studied both random Copy-Paste, where objects are randomly pasted onto images, and pasting objects based on the surrounding visual context. In this paper, we develop GeometryPaste, a method of pasting objects according to the geometry and context of the objects and background images. We build a small dataset of roadwork objects and fine-tune a pre-trained instance segmentation model to evaluate our method. Our results are compared against both baseline and random Copy-Paste APs. The results suggest that GeometryPaste may provide performance improvements over both baseline and random Copy-Paste augmentation for instance segmentation of rare object categories in small datasets.},

  abstract = {Autonomous navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become an increasingly popular area of study as technology has advanced over the years. One technology that has been developed for use in the autonomous navigation of UAVs is fiducial markers. Fiducial markers are a type of physical tag that can be placed in an environment to assist with UAV localization, navigation, and landing. A UAV can identify and scan a fiducial marker with an onboard camera and take appropriate action based on the data received from the marker. Previous research using only fiducial markers and onboard sensors for UAV navigation in a GPS-denied environment requires the camera to have constant visual contact with at least one marker. This paper explores the use of fiducial markers for outdoor UAV navigation in a GPS-denied environment without the restriction of constant visual contact with a marker. Physical implementation and formal methods are used to study the performance and overall viability of this solution.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
