I am an undergraduate student double majoring in mathematics and computer science at [Columbus State University](https://www.columbusstate.edu/), where I am also a tutor for both subjects.

This past summer, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [Robotics Institute]( https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)]( https://www.cmu.edu/) as part of the [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS)]( https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) program. My research focused on improving instance segmentation performance of computer vision machine learning models. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christoph Mertz]( https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/) and collaborate with several others in the CMU community.

During the summer of 2021, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://eng.auburn.edu/csse/) at [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) as part of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) on Smart Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Our research focused on autonomously navigating UAVs through a GPS-denied environment using computer vision, onboard cameras and sensors, and fiducial markers.

After completing my bachelorâ€™s degrees, I plan to pursue a master's degree in computer science focusing on developing machine learning algorithms.
