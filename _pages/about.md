Hi, I'm Nick. I am a master's student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I earned my bachelor’s degrees in both computer science and mathematics in 2024 from [Columbus State University](https://www.columbusstate.edu/), where I was also a tutor for both subjects.

During the summer of 2023, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at CMU as part of the [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS)](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) program. My research focused on improving instance segmentation performance of computer vision machine learning models. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/) and collaborate with several others in the CMU community.

During the summer of 2021, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://eng.auburn.edu/csse/) at [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) as part of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) on Smart Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Our research focused on autonomously navigating UAVs through a GPS-denied environment using computer vision, onboard cameras and sensors, and fiducial markers.

I also previously worked as a firefighter/EMT 🚒🔥🚑 and as a telecommunications technician providing phone 📞 and internet 💻 service to the military.
