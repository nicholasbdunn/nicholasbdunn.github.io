        One project that I enjoyed working on and learned a lot from was my smart alarm system. I designed and implemented the system using an Arduino Uno, fingerprint scanner, motion detector, buzzer, push button, LED, and a Wi-Fi module. The push button was used to arm the system and activate the LED to indicate the systemâ€™s state. After detecting motion, the buzzer would sound, and the LED would blink continuously. The Wi-Fi module was then used to transmit data to a cloud storage account to indicate alarm activation. Finally, the fingerprint scanner enabled registered users to deactivate the alarm. The system performed successfully and provided user authentication based on the confidence level of a fingerprint match.
